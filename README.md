# Move Your Body

Code provided in this repository gets the raw data from MPU-6050 and MAX30100, calculates a step counter and heart rate, and stores it in the ESP-32 SPIFFS to be send via bluetooth to an app.

## Components

To make this code work, you need the following components:

* This repository. It contains submodules, so make sure you clone it with `--recursive` option. If you have already cloned it without `--recursive`, run `git submodule update --init`.
* [ESP 32](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) module.
* [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).
* [MPU-6050](https://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/mpu-6050/) module.
* [MAX30100](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/MAX30100.html) module.

### ESP 32

Any ESP 32 module should work.

### ESP-IDF

Configure your PC according to [ESP 32 Documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/?badge=latest?badge=latest). Windows, Linux and Mac OS are supported.

### MPU-6050

This example has been tested with a MPU-6050. 

The MPU-6000 should work aswell.

### MAX30100

Any MAX30100 module should work.

## Quick Start

If you have your components ready, follow this section to [connect](#connect) the components to the ESP 32 module, [flash](#flash) application to the ESP 32 and [monitor](#monitor) the data.

### Connect

The pins used in this project to connect the ESP 32 to the MPU-6050 and MAX30100 are shown in the table below. The pinout can be adjusted in the software.

| Interface | MPU-6050 Pin | MAX30100 Pin | ESP 32 Pin Mapping |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| I2C Serial Clock | SCL | SCL | IO25 |
| I2C Serial Data | SDA | SDA | IO26 |
| Power Supply 3.3V | VCC | VIN | 3V3 |
| Ground | GND | GND | GND |

Notes:

If the sensors are not communicating with the ESP 32, consider adding 10kÎ© pull-up resistors to the SCL and SDA lines.

If you're using ESP 32 on Windows and is having the [ESP 32 Reset To Bootloader Issue (#136)](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/issues/136), add a 2.2uF capacitor conencted between GND and EN pins of ESP 32 module.

### Configuration and Flash

1. Clone the code provided in this repository to your PC.

2. To use the SPIFFS, you need a tool to create the SPIFFS partition image - I recommend using [igrr](https://github.com/igrr)'s [mkspiffs](https://github.com/igrr/mkspiffs).
After creating the SPIFFS image, use the esptool to flash it to the module.
If you're gonna use the partitions.csv, use the following config:
```
BLOCK SIZE = 4096
PAGE SIZE = 256
PARTITION SIZE = 0x2F0000
PARTITION OFFSET = 0x110000
```

3. On the menuconfig, use the following options:
    Flash size: 4MB;
    Partition Table: Custom Partition Table CSV, and choose the partitions.csv file.

4. Compile with the latest ESP-IDF installed from GitHub and download it to the module.

## How it Works

### Software

The software has 3 libraries, all located in the components folder:
* [esp32_i2c_rw.c](components/esp32-i2c_rw/esp32_i2c_rw.c) and [include/esp32_i2c_rw.h](components/esp32-i2c_rw/include/esp32_i2c_rw/esp32_i2c_rw.h) - library with read/write function for the I2C communication used in the [MPU-6050](components/esp32-mpu6050/mpu6050.c) library.
* [mpu6050.c](components/esp32-mpu6050/mpu6050.c) and [include/mpu6050.h](components/esp32-mpu6050/include/mpu6050/mpu6050.h) - setters/getters functions for the MPU-6050 registers and other functions like calibrate and self-test and [include/mpu6050_registers.h](components/esp32-mpu6050/include/mpu6050/mpu6050_registers.h) - definition of the registers of the MPU-6050.
* [max30100.c](components/esp32-max30100/max30100.c) and [include/max30100.h](components/esp32-max30100/include/max30100/max30100.h) - setters/getters functions for the MAX30100 registers and implementations of butterworth filter and DC removal filter and [include/registers.h](components/esp32-max30100/include/max30100/registers.h) - definition of the registers of the MAX30100.

Application is executed from main.c file located in main folder.

## Next Steps

We are planning to add the bluetooth functionality to send the data stored in the SPIFFS to an app.
